2. Detailed Breakdown
PS 26025 — Mine Subsidence Monitoring, Prediction & Early Warning
Organization: Ministry of Coal | Theme: Disaster Management | Target HW: LoRa/Zigbee mesh sensor nodes (ESP32/Raspberry Pi)
Problem, concisely: Deploy a distributed wireless mesh network of low-cost sensor nodes (tilt, vibration, displacement/strain, crack detection) over underground coal mine panels. Use AI/ML to detect abnormal ground deformation patterns and issue early-warning alerts via a GIS-based dashboard, with offline capability and periodic cloud sync.
Skills required:
·	Embedded C/C++ (Arduino/ESP32) — sensor interfacing (I2C/SPI/analog)
·	Basic electronics/wiring — node construction, power management
·	LoRa/mesh networking (or WiFi mesh via painlessMesh as an easier fallback)
·	Backend development (Python/Flask or Node.js) + database
·	Frontend/web development (HTML/JS + Leaflet.js for the GIS map)
·	Basic time-series statistics or scikit-learn for anomaly detection
Pros:
·	Splits naturally into 6 distinct, non-overlapping ownership areas — ideal for a 6-person team
·	Scales "for free" with team size: more people → more physical nodes → more convincing live mesh-resilience demo (e.g., kill a node mid-demo, show rerouting)
·	All components are commodity/cheap (₹200–800 per sensor)
·	Fully buildable, physically demonstrable end-to-end in hackathon timeframe
·	ML bar can start simple (threshold-based) and scale up if time allows
Cons / Challenges:
·	Many moving parts (embedded + networking + backend + frontend + ML) require coordination across the whole team
·	True multi-hop mesh networking can be finicky to debug under time pressure
·	Needs a physical demo rig (tiltable platform) to land the "wow" factor — easy to forget until late
Traps to avoid:
·	Building only 2–3 nodes and calling it a "mesh" — too weak a demo to prove the concept
·	Skipping the physical tilt-rig demo — without it, judges only see numbers, not the actual use case
·	Over-investing in ML sophistication before the fusion logic and physical layer are solid
·	Claiming offline-and-sync capability in the pitch without actually implementing it

PS 26172 — Low Latency and Efficient Voice Activator for Edge Devices
Organization: ISRO | Theme: Miscellaneous | Target HW: ESP32 / Raspberry Pi
Problem, concisely: Build an ultra-lightweight keyword-spotting (KWS) model that runs locally under 256KB RAM and <10% idle CPU. On detecting a custom wake word (no pre-trained "Hey Google"-style keywords allowed), stream the following audio to a cloud ASR server with minimal latency. Open-source frameworks only (TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, PyTorch Mobile, etc.).
Skills required:
·	Python (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) — model training
·	Audio DSP fundamentals (MFCC/mel-spectrogram feature extraction)
·	Embedded C/C++ (ESP-IDF or Arduino) — mic driver, inference loop
·	Model quantization / TFLite Micro (int8 quantization to fit the RAM budget)
·	Basic networking (sockets/MQTT) — the cloud handoff
·	Dataset handling and augmentation (noise injection, pitch/time shift) to compensate for a small custom dataset
Pros:
·	Narrow, deep problem — a 2-person core team (ML + embedded) can carry it entirely
·	Cheap hardware (~₹400 for an ESP32), extensive tutorials and documentation
·	Clear, measurable evaluation metrics (idle CPU%, RAM footprint, false-accept rate, latency) that translate directly into a strong demo
·	Plays well to skillsets adjacent to DSP/quantization/embedded work
Cons / Challenges:
·	Core loop is narrow — with 6 people, 4 can be under-utilized unless scope is deliberately expanded
·	Custom dataset collection (samples + negatives + noise conditions) takes real time and discipline
·	Quantization can noticeably hurt accuracy; may need quantization-aware training to recover it
Traps to avoid:
·	Using any model pre-trained on generic assistant keywords ("Hey Google," "Alexa") — explicitly disqualified
·	Shipping an uncompressed/heavy model that blows the 256KB ceiling
·	Leaving half the team without a real role — deliberately assign extra members to rigorous validation (large benchmark dataset, false-accept/reject testing), multi-platform benchmarking (ESP32 vs. Pi Pico vs. another MCU), and a live metrics dashboard for the demo
·	Treating this as "done" once the light turns on — the PS's actual evaluation criteria are the four measured metrics, not just detection working once

PS 26049 — Reliability of Electrical/Electronic Systems in Ladakh HAA/SHAA
Organization: DRDO | Theme: Smart Automation
Problem, concisely: Ladakh's extreme cold (-35°C to -40°C), low atmospheric pressure, low oxygen, high UV/cosmic radiation, and large day-night thermal swings degrade electronics through seven distinct failure modes: reduced cooling efficiency, insulation breakdown/arcing, battery degradation, thermal-cycling solder fatigue, radiation-induced semiconductor/memory errors, and communication signal issues. The PS explicitly cites drone battery/motor drain (60min flight at sea level → ~20-25min in Ladakh) as its real-world example.
Skills required:
·	Electronics/thermal design — battery pack and BMS-level knowledge
·	Control systems basics (PID or bang-bang control loops) for thermal management
·	Basic mechanical/materials understanding (insulation, enclosure design)
·	Literature research and technical-methodology writing — needed for the failure modes you can't physically test
Pros:
·	The PS itself hands you a scoping anchor: the drone battery example tells you exactly what a compelling, narrow demo looks like
·	The battery-thermal-management subset is testable with normal resources (a household freezer or dry ice gets you to -20 to -30°C)
·	Forgiving of literature-backed reasoning for untestable failure modes (low pressure, radiation) — honest scoping is respected more than overclaiming
·	Uses a different skillset than 26025/26172, so it doesn't compete for the same team members if run as a 3rd option
Cons / Challenges:
·	Broad list of seven failure modes tempts teams into shallow, scattered coverage
·	Some effects (low-pressure dielectric breakdown, cosmic radiation damage) cannot be physically tested without specialized chambers
Traps to avoid:
·	Trying to address all seven failure modes shallowly — this reads as a literature survey, not engineering work
·	Claiming to have tested low-pressure or radiation effects without the equipment to back it up
·	Not assigning someone to explicitly own the "how we addressed what we couldn't physically test" narrative — DRDO judges will specifically probe this

PS 26185 — Helmet-Mounted Conformal Antenna for Tactical Comms
Organization: Ministry of Home Affairs (NSG) | Theme: Defence/Security | Target HW: Flexible conformal microstrip patch antenna (UHF & L-Band)
Problem, concisely: Design a low-profile, flexible, conformal microstrip antenna array integrated onto an NSG ballistic helmet, supporting dual-band (UHF + L-Band) operation for tactical radios and helmet cameras, with an RF shielding layer to protect the wearer while directing gain outward, connected via a ruggedized coax interface.
Skills required:
·	Antenna theory (impedance matching, Smith charts, gain/directivity) — typically a junior/senior EM coursework topic
·	EM simulation software: HFSS, CST (student license), or the free/open-source openEMS
·	Flexible-substrate PCB fabrication (Kapton or flexible FR4)
·	RF shielding layer design
·	VNA-based validation (S11/return loss, impedance matching)
Pros:
·	Narrower scope than the multi-subsystem PSs — it's "just" the antenna, not a full communications system
·	If lab access exists, the simulate → fabricate → validate workflow parallels other EDA-style design flows
Cons / Challenges (this is a hard access gate, not just a difficulty curve):
·	Requires an RF/antenna lab with a VNA — many colleges won't have this
·	Antenna design theory is typically beyond sophomore coursework; needs a mentor or serious self-study
·	Fabricating flexible substrates needs a PCB lab that supports flex-PCB work — not universally available
·	No access to real NSG ballistic helmets; testing/integration claims will be on a generic mockup at best
Traps to avoid:
·	Attempting to size antenna dimensions without simulation software — this will not produce a working design
·	Overclaiming ballistic-integrity testing that was never actually performed
·	Underestimating the difficulty of stacking dual-band + conformal + shielding requirements simultaneously — each alone is nontrivial
Conditional verdict: Only move this above 26049 if your college has genuine RF lab access and at least one team member with antenna theory background. Without both, it should not be a serious option.

PS 26026 — Quadruped/Handheld Detection of Narcotics & Explosives (Indian Railways) — RED FLAG
Organization: Ministry of Railways | Theme: Robotics & Drones
Problem, concisely: Build an AI-enabled mobile quadruped robotic platform and a handheld device for real-time detection of narcotics (heroin, cocaine, meth, cannabis derivatives, etc.) and explosives (RDX, TNT, PETN, TATP, C4, etc.) across railway stations, platforms, coaches, and yards — including LiDAR-based SLAM navigation, thermal/optical imaging, facial recognition, and secure real-time communication to control centres.
Skills that would be required (for reference only — not recommended to pursue):

Legged robotics control, LiDAR SLAM, sensor fusion, computer vision (facial recognition, thermal imaging), spectrometry/chemical sensing, secure communications/encryption, mechanical design.
Why this is a structural red flag, not just "hard":
·	Legal/safety barrier: students cannot legally possess real narcotics or explosives to calibrate a detector against — any demo either fabricates results or uses unverified surrogate compounds
·	Hardware cost: real narcotics/explosives detection needs Raman spectroscopy or ion-mobility spectrometry hardware costing several lakhs to tens of lakhs of rupees — not a "build it cheaper" problem, it's a physics-of-sensitivity problem
·	Quadruped robotics is a multi-year problem on its own: dynamic balance and gait control is a control-systems research area; commercial platforms cost lakhs
·	Five hard subsystems stapled together: mobility + spectrometric detection + facial recognition + secure comms + autonomous navigation — no realistic team integrates all five in hackathon time
·	Rescoping erases the PS: any workable version (wheeled robot, gas-sensor proxy, simulated targets) stops being a genuine answer to what was actually asked
Traps to avoid (if pursued anyway): fabricating/faking detection results in the demo; underestimating quadruped platform cost; presenting a rescoped wheeled-robot version as if it fulfills the original PS without clearly flagging the substitution; ignoring facial recognition's privacy/legal implications.

PS 26050 — High Altitude Performance Optimization of Anti-Drone Systems — RED FLAG
Organization: DRDO | Theme: Robotics & Drones
Problem, concisely: Harden an existing anti-drone system (detection, tracking, neutralization — spanning RF, electro-optical, mechanical, and stabilization subsystems) to maintain micro-radian pointing accuracy under Ladakh's extreme cold, low pressure, dust, and high-wind conditions, including compensation for temperature-induced cable rigidity and structural deformation.
Skills that would be required (for reference only — not recommended to pursue):

Precision controls/mechatronics (4th-year/graduate level), thermal-structural FEA (ANSYS/COMSOL/CalculiX), adaptive control algorithms (e.g., Kalman filtering), environmental qualification methodology (MIL-STD-style thinking) — plus everything needed to build or credibly simulate an anti-drone system in the first place.
Why this is a structural red flag, not just "hard":
·	Hidden prerequisite: the PS assumes a working anti-drone system already exists — you'd effectively need to solve 26026-level system integration first, before addressing what's actually asked
·	Precision control requirement exceeds undergrad coursework: maintaining micro-radian pointing under thermal/structural stress is typically 4th-year or graduate-level controls
·	Validation equipment is essentially inaccessible: thermal chambers reaching HAA/SHAA temperatures, low-pressure chambers, dust ingress rigs, wind-load benches — no realistic field test is possible without this
·	Elevated rigor bar: as a DRDO/IDEX PS, judges expect qualification-methodology reasoning (component derating, MIL-STD-style validation), not a hobbyist demo
·	Best-case realistic outcome is simulation-only: even with a well-scoped single-subsystem focus (e.g., gimbal pointing under simulated thermal drift), the ceiling is a rigorous methodology/simulation submission — not a working, field-tested demo
Traps to avoid (if pursued anyway): attempting to physically build and field-test the full system; presenting simulation results as though they were physically validated; underestimating that a credible demo requires solving the base anti-drone system first.

3. Why the Bottom Two Are Categorically Different From the Rest
For PS 26025, 26172, 26049, and 26185, the hard parts are things effort, planning, or lab access can genuinely solve — more team members, more testing time, better scoping, or securing lab access closes the gap.
For PS 26026 and 26050, the hard parts are structural: legal barriers to possessing real narcotics/explosives, hardware costs in the lakhs-to-crores range, prerequisite systems (quadruped robots, full anti-drone platforms) that are themselves multi-year engineering efforts, and validation equipment (spectrometers, HAA/SHAA environmental chambers) that doesn't exist at most universities regardless of team size or effort. That is the line between "difficult — pick if your team is prepared" and "red flag — avoid regardless of team strength."
4. Recommended Path Forward
1.	First choice: PS 26025 — best team-size fit, fully buildable, real physical demo achievable.
2.	Second choice: PS 26172 — plays to a concentrated ML/embedded skillset; expand scope deliberately (validation rigor, multi-platform benchmarking, live metrics dashboard) to use all 6 team members well.
3.	Third choice (backup): PS 26049 — genuinely buildable if scoped to the battery-thermal-management angle; different skillset from the top two.
4.	Conditional fourth choice: PS 26185 — only if your college has RF/antenna lab access and EM theory background on the team.
5.	Do not shortlist PS 26026 or PS 26050 unless no other option remains — both carry structural barriers no amount of team effort resolves within a hackathon timeframe.
